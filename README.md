iracing-road-only
=================

I wanted to clean up the forums that I never visit and focus on road activities only.
This also means cleaning up a bit of the membersite like hosted sessions and car filters.

# Installation
This script is [installable from GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/3753-iracing-road-only).

For those of you that don't use it, I recommend the chrome extension Tampermonkey by Jan Biniok.  It makes it easy to add userscripts and also triggers updating them when they are updated elsewhere  You may use this script with or without it, but I do recommend it.

# Features

## Forums
Currently it hides all of the following forums:
- oval
- club

It hides selected rows in:
- racing and championship
- regional
- paint
- tech

## Member site
- Changes the 'Series' link to go to the road filter by default
- Hides hosted sessions that are not on a road track.
- Filters cars in the race panel


# Additional comments
In it's current state, it's good for me, but it is opinionated. With a little work, it could have some toggle links to make it better for everyone.
